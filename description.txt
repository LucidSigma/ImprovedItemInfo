Improved Item Info (III) is mod that displays more comprehensive stats about weapons.
It essentially shows how the weapon is affected by modifiers and accessories, as well as adding extra tooltips (such as projectile velocity).

It is a spiritual successor to ItemStats+ (by Xahlicem) rewritten completely from scratch.

Has cross-mod support with Clicker Class and Calamity (Thorium is planned when it is ported to tModLoader 1.4).

All tooltips that this mod affects are configurable.

The mod is completely open source and is avaiable here: https://github.com/LucidSigma/ImprovedItemInfo
If you have anything you wish to contribute or want to fork it, you're more than welcome to.
The mod currently only works in English.

Stats affected:
* Damage.
* Critical strike chance.
* Use time (speed).
* Knockback.
* Mana usage.
* Ammo type/category.
* Projectile velocity.
* Projectile velocity multiplier.
* Clicks to activate click effect (if Clicker Class is installed).
* Thorium bard and healer stats are planned when Thorium is ported to 1.4.
